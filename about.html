  <div class="ww-panel ww-card-4"><p>Hey everyone, I'm Willie and I just want to say that technology rocks!  Being born in the 80's probably predestined me for being technology savvy or something, I'm not sure.  Between Nintendo and the Apple II computers, there was always something for me to get into.  To this day... I am surrounded by technology and I am absolutely thrilled about it.  Professionally I have done the work of many roles in information technology.  Roles have varied over the years from PC Support Technician to Network Administrator to Sr. Network/Systems Administrator to Director of Technology.  In general I have stayed in the public sector with local and state governments.  I did venture out into the education system working with educational technology but, have since returned to government.</p>
  <p>  There are so many challenges facing our organizations these days as it relates to cybersecurity.  As a former victim of identity theft, I have felt the bite of human error when it comes to having access to information and being swindled out of it.  It is my hope that this website will be of some use to all who come across it.  Awareness is what it takes to overcome cyber threats and challenges.  This is my contribuation to that fight.</p></div>
