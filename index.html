  <div class="ww-panel ww-card-4"><p>Green Day has sang a song in the past that begged for us to lay down our arms and give up the fight.  That is the hope of threat actors as they mercilessly hammer our networks minute by minute seeking for any vulnerability to exploit!  We have lots of tools available to keep an eye on our networks like RiskSense.  We employ tools like KnowBe4 to simulate ransomware.  We hold our IT meetings and rally the troops behind processes and procedures.  We spend the hundreds, thousands and millions on enterprise equipment that is supposed to be better than the equipment we just purchased three years ago.  In spite of all of this, all it takes is for a single user to <strong>not</strong> be on their A game for the day and all of a sudden our environment is crawling with malware or sensitive data has been mistakenly given away.</p>
  <p>Living this nightmare by yourself should be a thing of the past.  You know why?  Well, because your counterparts in many other organizations around the world are either dealing with the same thing you are or getting ready to deal with the same thing you are.  There is escaping the monster of phishing emails, ransomware attacks or other countless nightmares we fight daily as IT professionals. Do you remember the days where making hardware work with each other or building crosswalks for software upgrades were the challenges that kept us up at night?  Yeah, me either... but leaning on each other's professional experiences is what we need to do in the fight against cybercrime as well!  As someone who has personally lived through a ransomware attack that brought the network to a halt, I understand the blame that we put on ourselves and the shot that our confidence takes when it happens.  Only after the situation begins to subside do we realize that it happens to the best of us... and guess what?  With that experience that you've just gone through... you are one of the best and can help the next professional getting ready to deal with it.</div>

<div class="ww-container">
</div>
  <div class="ww-panel ww-card-4"><p>Did you notice that gas price skyrocket for a few weeks?  Yes, I surely did as well.  Our friends at Colonial Pipeline were hit by a nasty ransomware attack.  Initially when this hit the news, there was quite the defiance coming out of the organization.  Making claims of refusing to pay the ransom that was being demanded of them by the bad actors who had seized company data and resources.  You know one thing that gets me?  The request of the ransomware owners to be paid in bitcoin.  These guys are literally using technology against us in every possible way.  First they get into our systems covertly, take over all of the assets that we require to do business and then demand to be paid in a manner that to this point hasn't been able to be traced back with any high success rate.</p>
  <p>Pounding their chest and declaring "we don't negotiate with terrorists," initially, Colonial had reach over a week of being offline as their systems were held captive.  Very slowly they seem to be having some success restoring data from old backups, however it was fast enough because as degraded business looked like it was going to start dragging into a second week, Colonial decided to pay the group Darksied who claimed responsibility for the ransomware attack on the gasoline producing company.  What a mind job this can be.  Remember, I'm speaking from experience.  I've been involved in a ransomware attack where the organization had to pay multiple bitcoin in order to bring systems back online.  At that time the bitcoin was worth about 4k (USD) per coin.  After it was all said and done for Colonial Pipeline, their CEO authorized the payment of $4.4 Million (USD) in ransom to Darksied.  Wow... that's just amazing, in the most negative way.  This is what I like to refer to as unjust debt.  How does Colonial recover the 4.4 Million as well a the money they continued to lose while being offline?  That's right, they can't.  Score another one for the bad actors.</div>

  <div class="ww-panel ww-card-4"><p>What is it about Florida?  It must be Disney World, the Miami beaches or something.  They've been hit AGAIN!  This time it is one of the largest school districts in the United States of America and guess how much the bad actors are demanding? $40 Million (USD)!  What in the world is going on?  I am in the wrong business or something!  You know, I hear that you can purchase ransomware as a service now!  All joking aside, the students are losing out in this large and unfortunate situation.  You may recall that I have stated that I have experience in these scenarios?  Well, it's this <strong>exact</strong> scenario that I have experience in.  The school district, the students, the lack of answers, the complete work stoppage, the thought that your job security is now completely shot, the thought that it'd be kinder if they just fired you rather than waiting for answers from you.  Yeah, it's quite the trip that you go on when faced with these situations.  The fun part is coming up though...</p>
  <p>Determining how it happened.  I bet many professionals that have been in their environments for at least a few years probably believe they could pinpoint who potentially assisted, unknowningly, in bringing malware into the environment.  Here's my advice to you... that doesn't even matter at that point.  What matters and what should have mattered more up until this point is making your staff aware of the pitfalls to avoid when dealing with emails and websites and even <strong>phone calls</strong> these days.  The threat actors are so organized these days that they will make phone calls directly to you, likely getting your information from the business website that organizations must have to remain competitive and be validated as legit.  The information contained on our websites give the threat actors everything they need to conjure up a very convincing email and send it to the person that is going to be vulnerable on that given day.  That is likely a piece of what has happened at the Florida school district.  Timing couldn't have been better though because at this point all of the students should be out of school.</div>

<div class="ww-container">
</div>
  <div class="ww-panel ww-card-4"><p>So, did you know that just over 50% of organizations that experience a ransomware attack actually <strong>pay the ransom</strong>!  That is quite the success rate for the threat actors that continually carry out this barage of attacks on unsuspecting organizations.  According to Atlas VPN, for those organizations that refuse to pay the ransom, they end up spending an <strong>average</strong> of $732,520!  Now granted that is a heck of a lot less than the millions we've been hearing about recently from organizations such as Colonial Pipeline.  Hoever, that is several times more than what I personally experienced having to arrange to pay in a former place of employment.</p>
  <p>Ransomware attacks have increased over 700% from 2019 to 2020.  I wonder what the stats are for this year?  I would imagine they are staggeringly sobering.  Let's take a look at the top 5 ransomware variants that are hammering our organizations:</p>
  <p><li><strong>REvil/Sodinokibi</strong></li></p>
  <p>REvil is the most prevalent type of ransomware in circulation today. According to IBM, REvil and its subvariant Sodinokibi account for 29% of all ransomware attacks. It is conservatively estimated that the REvil ransomware group netted a profit of $123 million in 2020 alone.</p>
  <p><li><strong>Maze</strong></li></p>
  <p>Maze was the number-two most prevalent form of ransomware in 2020, accounting for 12% of all ransomware attacks. It is a relatively new variant, first discovered in the wild in May 2019.</p>

<p>Maze is notorious for threatening to publicly publish sensitive customer data from the affected system if ransom demands are not met. Experts consider Maze to be one of the most destructive ransomware variants operating today.</p>
  <p><li><strong>Ryuk</strong></li></p>
  <p>The Ryuk ransomware variant completely blocks access to the victim’s system until the ransom demands are met. It works by using military-grade encryption to prevent users from accessing files, systems, and devices.</p>

<p>This ransomware typically targets large corporations and government agencies. It uses other malware to infect a system then goes about encrypting targeted files with a unique key for each file.</p>
  <p><li><strong>Tycoon</strong></li></p>
  <p>The Tycoon ransomware most often targets educational institutions, government agencies, and software companies. It is also a newer variant, first identified in December 2019 and has been particularly active during the COVID-19 shutdown, infecting the personal computers of employees forced to work from home. It takes advantage of the lax security typical of remote workers, including the poorly encrypted VPN tools many workers use to access their work networks. This ransomware is written in Java and most often deployed as a Trojan horse attached to the Java Runtime Environment.<p>
  <p><li><strong>Netwalker</strong></li></p>
  <p>Like Tycoon, NetWalker gained popularity following the COVID-19 shutdown early in 2020. It is most commonly delivered via email phishing campaigns and targets all sizes and types of businesses, healthcare organizations, educational institutions, and government agencies. After it infects a network it encrypts all the Windows devices connected to that network.</p>
